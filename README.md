# Autonomous Driving Software Engineering
This repository contains my homework code of the lecture Autonomous Driving Software Engineering ([MW2472] Softwareentwicklung für autonomes Fahren), which I attended during the winter semester 2021/22 in Technical University of Munich.

In this lectrue, I have learned about the technical framework of autonomous driving, got familiar with the common-used methodologies and algorithms of the stacks.
Every week after the lecture, the corresponding homework tasks would be released, and we had four weeks to finish each of them.
